## 🎯 Research Objectives

- Understand barriers to **Foodpanda Pro** subscription using a structured hypothesis-driven approach.
- Identify how **cost, awareness, effort expectancy, social influence, trust**, and **habit** impact user decisions.
- Assess the role of **demographics and ordering frequency** in shaping perceived value.
- Recommend potential **interventions** for improving user conversion.

## 🔍 Framework & Methodology

- **UTAUT2 Model**: Includes constructs such as Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, Hedonic Motivation, Price Value, Habit, and Trust.
- **Custom Additions**: Awareness and Demographics were added to better localize the model.
- **Data Collection**: Primary survey data of Foodpanda users segmented by usage, subscription status, and context.
- **Analysis Tools**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib (in Jupyter Notebook).

## 📌 Highlighted Findings

- 🚫 **Low Awareness** of Pro benefits is a major barrier to adoption.
- 💸 **Price sensitivity** persists, especially due to the Rs. 599 minimum for free delivery.
- 🔁 **Infrequent users** find the subscription irrelevant due to low order frequency.
- 👎 **UX friction** in the subscription process discourages potential users.
- 🤝 **Social influence and trust** play moderate roles, more relevant in edge cases.
